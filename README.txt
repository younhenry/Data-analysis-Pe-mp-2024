This repository contains data and code needed to perform the analyses and figures in our manuscript:

"Pseudomonas entomophila is highly pathogenic to fruit flies in the absence of methylparaben" (by Youn Henry, Berta Canal-Dom√®nech, Christine La Mendola, Tadeusz J. Kawecki)

General info

*analyses are separated into three folders, with one script each.
	-One folder is dedicated to the analysis of in vitro growth of bacteria in the presence of antifungal or not
	-A second folder is dedicated to the analysis of survival, Pe load and offspring survival
	-A thrid folder is dedicated to the analysis of indirect transmission of Pe through the environement

*each folder contains data in .txt format, corresponding R script in Rmd format (including notes with some information about the analysis), and the knitted html document in markdown

*IMPORTANT: all R codes use the `pacman` package to automatically install and load packages. It is practical, yet, some packages can only be installed separately (e.g. cmdstanr). Please install these packages before running the pacman script.

*The R code uses the `here` package (see also [here](https://github.com/jennybc/here_here)). This means all file paths are relative, and the analysis should work on your computer no questions asked, whether you use the R project or not, no code line to change as long as you download the entire repo. However, be sure to open the script from the the folder where it is located, to be sure R understands its location.

*If you run the script for the first time, time-consuming outputs like models will be saved in the same folder as the script so you don't have to re-run them everytime.

*If you don't need to run the code but simply look at it and its outputs, a knitted html document allows to visualize that without running anything.
